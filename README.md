# 16 Bit Processor
Making a 16 Bit Processor using Verilog, which is modelled after the RISC-V ISA.

Contains all the basic components seen in a 16-bit processor, like an Instruction Decoder, Registers, ALU Units and Memory Units. Comes with a barebones tb file, which you can modify based on your need.

The file can be compiled using icarus verilog and waveforms can be observed using gtkwave.
